# 🧠 Anubhuti Analytics Wiki

Welcome to the **Anubhuti Analytics Engineering Wiki**!

This wiki serves as a central knowledge hub for our engineering team.  
It outlines our conventions, best practices, and expectations — helping us maintain a consistent, high-quality codebase and collaboration culture.

## 📘 Before You Begin

If you’re working on something new, please review the following guidelines first.  
They ensure we stay aligned on code style, structure, and communication.

- 🧩 [Engineering Standards](https://anubhutianalytics.github.io/wiki/conventions/engineering-standards)
- 🔢 [Semantic Versioning](https://anubhutianalytics.github.io/wiki/conventions/semantic-versioning)

## 🛠️ Continuous Improvement

You may come across existing code or material that doesn’t fully follow these standards — that’s okay!  
Please help us improve:
- Update or refactor where appropriate.
- Discuss proposed changes with the team before updating a convention.
- Keep documentation current and clear.
